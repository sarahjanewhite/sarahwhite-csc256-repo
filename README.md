# Hello World!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Sarah White. I am 27 years old and currently live in North Carolina. I’m also a software development student and programmer, honing my skills in coding and problem-solving. Whether it’s creating an abstract class in Java or tackling a new coding challenge, I’m passionate about building solutions and pushing myself to learn and grow in my field.

Currently, I work as a graphic designer for my church. I love my job but am looking for something new and engaging to tackle. After I graduate, I plan on searching for a job. If this doesn't go as planned, I plan on enlisting in the Navy and starting a new career there!
